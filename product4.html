Stainless steel is a popular material for jewelry because it’s affordable and durable. 
Unlike other softer materials, it can withstand most daily activities without sustaining corrosion and scratches. 
Plus, stainless steel jewelry doesn’t tarnish so it looks good even with minimal maintenance.
It's also excellent for those who are allergic to certain metals or prefer to avoid silver and gold. 
Stainless steel jewelry has many advantages, but before you go ahead and buy stainless steel jewelry, here are some things you need to know.
